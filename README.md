# Coding_challenge_HUK
Code submission for the insurance claims prediction

This repository contains the solution for the insurance claims prediction coding challenge as part of the HUK-Coburg technical interview process.

## Overview

The goal of the challenge was to:
- Predict the **expected claim amount** (`ExpectedClaim`) for insurance policyholders based on risk features and claim history.
- Evaluate and find an optimal model.

## Key Highlights

- **Final Model**: LightGBM, selected for its excellent performance (lowest RMSE and small MAE) and training efficiency.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Data preparation, feature encoding, and outlier handling.
  - Model evaluation and selection.
  - Visualization of results, including feature importance and residual analysis.

## Repository Contents

- **notebook.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook with the full analysis and results.
- **requirements.txt**: Optional list of dependencies used in the notebook.
